[00:00.51] Feeling good, like I should
[00:04.91] Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
[00:09.48] Feeling blessed, never stressed
[00:13.60] Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
[00:31.10] 
[00:18.65] Every day can be a better day despite the challenge
[00:23.05] All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
[00:27.45] It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance
[00:31.95] I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it
[00:57.95] 
[00:36.38] Everyone falls down sometimes
[00:40.62] But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
[00:44.82] It's okay, uh-huh
[00:49.43] It's okay
[00:53.93] 
[00:54.08] Feeling good, like I should
[00:58.33] Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
[01:02.80] Feeling blessed, never stressed
[01:07.12] Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
[01:24.62] 
[01:11.94] Some days you wake up
[01:13.48] And nothing works, you feel surrounded
[01:16.57] Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
[01:21.05] Keep good things inside your ears
[01:23.09] Just like the waves and sound did
[01:25.43] And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it
[01:52.43] 
[01:29.97] Everyone falls down sometimes
[01:34.06] But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
[01:38.15] It's okay, uh-huh
[01:42.83] It's okay
[01:47.33] 
[01:47.65] Feeling good, like I should
[01:52.24] Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
[01:56.90] Feeling blessed, never stressed
[02:01.96] Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
[02:19.46] 
[02:06.57] Feeling good, like I should
[02:10.81] Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
[02:15.28] Feeling blessed, never stressed
[02:19.65] Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
