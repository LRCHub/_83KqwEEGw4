You'd always dress in your Sunday best
Whatever mood you're in
Always waiting to be blessed
Whether we sink or swim
You'd always dress in your Sunday best
In spite of everything
Said that sex is meaningless
There's more important things
Well how
Would you feel if I was somewhere else?
And how
Would you feel if it was someone else?
Someone else
You'd always dress in your Sunday best
Whatever plane you're on
Said that life is but a test
Goes on and on
Well how
Would you feel if I was someone else?
And how
Would you feel if it was somewhere else?
Somewhere else
How many times must we fall into this
Where our words get untied by the wrist
How many times must we fall into this
Where our words get untied by the wrist
As we get older
Must we get colder
We are still glistening
If only you were listening
As we get older
Must we get colder
We are still glistening
If only you were listening
Look don't listen in
Look don't listen in
Look don't listen in
Look don't listen in
Look don't listen in
Look don't listen in
Look don't listen in
Look don't listen in
