Ay, feeling good, like I should

Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
I got that sunshine on my Sunday best

Yeah, oh, everyday can be a better day despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it

E-e-everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, (yeah) uh-huh, uh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

Ay, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
I got that sunshine on my Sunday best

Oh, somedays you wake up
And nothing works, you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears
Just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it

'Cause everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, (yeah) uh-huh, uh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

Ay, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
I'm feeling blessed, (yeah) never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best

Ay, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
I'm feeling blessed, never stressed
I got that sunshine on my Sunday best

I'm feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
I'm feeling blessed, never stressed
I got that sunshine on my Sunday best
I got that sunshine on my Sunday best
