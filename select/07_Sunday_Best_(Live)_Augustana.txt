When she's sleeping on the sofa,
When she's laying in her Sunday best,
When she's turning over Friday,
I could swear I'm sleeping less and less...
And the ocean's getting warmer,
And California's on her mind,
Los Angeles is tired, but we always seem to feel alright,

But I won't...
No I won't...

Cause she's already out the door,
She's already out of here
She's already gone away... already gone away...

When I'm coming over Sunday
And I think about you all the time,
I wonder what you're doin
I wonder why you never cry,
When Boston's always raining,
And we never ever seemed alive,
I sung about you once now, I guess I might as well

But I won't...
No I won't...

Cause she's already out the door,
She's already out of here
She's already gone away... already gone away...
