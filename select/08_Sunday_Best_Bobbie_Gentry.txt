When I'm walkin' hand in hand with you
I've got my yellow parasol, rivets colored blue
Shiny patent leather shoes, bran' new
Nothin' but my Sunday best for you

Oh, it's such a pleasure
I can hardly speak
Each day is a treasure
It's Sunday every day of the week

I will give you all of my love, so true
Nothin' but my Sunday best will do
Nothin' but my Sunday best for you

Oh, it's such a pleasure
I can hardly speak
Each day is a treasure
It's Sunday every day of the week

I will give you all of my love, so true
Nothin' but my Sunday best will do
Nothin' but my Sunday best for you
